**I made this archive to preserve the history of the game updates and to keep safe the history of versions (including bug fixes and mean), so feel free to explore and check out what the game used to like at the start!**

For the developers who are interested, please use this to help suggestion future changes and updates based on the past versions, you can suggestions updates on the [fourms](https://mathquiz.boards.net/board/7/suggestions) or on [Facebook](Facebook.com/mathquizonline)

But its mostly for the people who are just wanting to know where it all started off!
